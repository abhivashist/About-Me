    <h2>LECTURES & MY OPINION</h2><hr>
    <h3><mark>1.C-programming</mark></h3>
    <p> The experience of leaning C here in MANIT is wonderful. I also learnt C before but the  way Anirban Sir is teaching is fab and mind blowing.
        He explains the reason behind everything and that makes the difference.
        I thought that I have learnt C now it is practice time but after studying from sir i have found that I skipped so much part. 
       <br> THANKS sir for teaching us in this way.
    </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3><mark>2.Operating system</mark></h3>
         <p>I did not learn much of operating system in my BCA but now i am learning it very carefully  and ma'am is also doing hardwork 
         with us.<br> I did not understand any of the algorithm in my BCA but now I surely able to read thid in easy flow.<br>
         THANKS ma'am for guiding us.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3><mark>3.Data Structure </mark></h3>
         <p>I have learnt somewhat Data Structure earlier but do not know how to implement it using any computer programming language.
             But now I make littlebit Programs regarding Data structure and Amit Bhagat sir is also helping us to learn this complex subject with an ease
             <br>THANKS sir for teaching us this way  </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

             <h3><mark>4. Mathematics </mark></h3>
         <p>A little bit problem is going on in maths but i hope that one day I will overcome all these problems .
             Manoj Jhaa sir explains everything so clearly and step by step but i did not do self study in this subject.
            Hope so that i will do it properly soon. i lagged behind in this due to my lack of self study.
        <br>THANKS sir for mentoring and guidind us and for making our interest in this typicall subject. </p>
